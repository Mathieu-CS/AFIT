Hi! You are now in the repository of my first project at EPITA.

I didn't upload the subject as it belongs to my school and 
therefore I have no rights over it.

I didn't upload the dune config which allows the project to compile 
in the form that was programmed by the school neither. 

What you can find in the source folder is only the code that I wrote 
in the early stages of my programming journey. (very messy but it worked!)

This project is a series of exercises about arithmetic and cryptography
protocols such as RSA and El Gamal.

The builtin folder contains the project in the classic form and the 
scalable part is the project but using a reversed binary form for the 
variables (It has been a long time so I am not sure if "reversed
binary" is the correct term for the implementation we used).

The multithrading part was a bonus part which I didn't do as it was too
hard for me at the time, from what I remember it involved the chinese
remainder theorem.

I received a grade of 18 out of 20 for this project.
